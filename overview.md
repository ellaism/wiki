<!-- TITLE: Overview -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Overview -->

Ellaism is an Ethereum clone using a blend of ETC and ETH code, and intends to use exclusively “proof of work” to secure the blockchain.  It benefits from a zero pre-mine and has no mandatory developer fees with all support and development donated freely by the community.  We believe this makes our coin one of the most honest pure Ethereum projects, and something that is uniquely interesting as a platform for serious developers, educators, and enthusiasts.

Ellaism also has a clearly defined monetary policy, with around 280 million coins in total. See also [Comparison of Different Ethereum Networks](/comparison/).

This is an Ethereum network as specified in the [yellow
paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), with
[Homestead](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2.md),
[EIP150](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/150),
[EIP155](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/155),
[EIP160](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/160) and
[ECIP1017](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md)
applied from block 0. The era for ECIP1017 is changed to 10 million. Chain id
and network id are both `0x40`. Difficulty bomb is diffused from block 0.

Genesis block contains 0 coins (hence no premine). The initial difficulty in
genesis block is changed to `0x40000000`, its extra data field is
`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, and its
initial nonce is `0x0000000000000040`.
